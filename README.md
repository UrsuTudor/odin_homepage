# Homepage Design

This is a simple, responsive homepage design showcasing my CSS capabilities. The layout and design concept were inspired by The Odin Projectâ€™s Homepage design project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-advanced-html-and-css-homepage.

All code is written by me, focusing on responsive styling. The homepage is live here: https://homepage-design.fly.dev.


## CSS and Layout Highlights
* Flexible layout with Flexbox and CSS Grid: The contact and author sections use a combination of flexbox and grid to create balanced, responsive layouts that adapt well across desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints.

* Responsive typography and sizing: Font sizes and element widths use clamp() and viewport-relative units (vw, vh) for scalable and accessible text and images.

* Visual layering and effects: The author header includes a skewed background shape created with ::before and transform for dynamic visual interest, combined with subtle box shadows for depth.

* Adaptive content visibility: Some decorative elements (e.g., icons in .phone_number and .mail) are hidden on smaller screens to simplify the UI.
